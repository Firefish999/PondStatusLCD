Pond status monitoring via MySQL  ARDUINO/ESP8266

This Project is an adjunct to the MarksPondController project.

It takes the data generated by the master Pond Controller, that is inserted into an MySQL database, extracts it and displays it on an LCD.
It is WiFI connected and draws time from an NTP server. It uses time validation to ensure the data on the MySQL Service is recent.
